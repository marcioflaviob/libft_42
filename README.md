# libft

My very first library in c.
For this project, I recoded a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that I will use during my whole course.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcioflaviob/libft_42.git && cd libft_42
```

## Usage

```bash
make
```

For even more functions:

```bash
make bonus
```

This will compile the library you should include the header in your project 
to use the functions of the library.

```c
import "path/to/libft.h"
```
Compiling your file :

```bash
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror your_file.c libft.a
```
